This project is for building a sample game using Unity 6.3's new
Low Level 2D Physics feature.

This directory itself is a Unity project, and reference materials are
stored under References.

- References/Documentation - partial documentation of Low Level 2D Physics
- References/LowLevelSamples - official samples of Low Level 2D Physics

Because Low Level 2D Physics is a new feature, there will likely be
many aspects beyond your (agent) knowledge. When working, please
refer to these materials as needed.

Also, because Low Level 2D Physics is based on Box2D v3, there are many
situations where you can apply your Box2D knowledge directly. Please
keep that in mind at all times.
